			I'm a 3rd year computer science student at Aalto-University, with minors in Data Science and
			Mathematics. I'm a highly motivated individual who is passionate about exploring the limitless
			possibilities that technology has to offer. During my studies, I have developed a good
			understanding of programming languages such as Python, Scala, Typescript and C++, which has
			enabled me to take on projects ranging from simple web applications to more-complex
			algorithms.
			<br /><br />
			As a part of my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on exciting projects such
			as the implementation of a tool for calibration technicians at Beamex. The project involved using
			React Native to develop an android-based application for calibration technicians to perform their
			work more efficiently. The experience allowed me to understand the significance of solving real-world
			problems and the importance of collaboration in the process. I learned how to work as a team and
			contribute towards a common goal.
			<br /><br />
			One of my core strengths is my ability to work with Git and collaborate effectively with team members.
			I understand that each team member brings their unique skill set and perspective to the table,
			and it is crucial to consider everyone's input while working on a project. I believe that being
			transparent, communicating effectively, and ensuring equal participation from all members of the
			team is the key to successful collaboration.
			<br /><br />
			I'm interested in exploring new frameworks and technologies and continuously strive to expand my
			knowledge in the field. I strongly believe that technology has the power to bring positive change
			to the world, and I hope to contribute to this through my work.
